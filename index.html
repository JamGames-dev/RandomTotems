              <h4>Detective Max Mystery:<br>Double Clues Murder</h4>
              <p>Almost a year has passed since my first investigation - the Conor school case. I decided to take a break before going to university. I visited several countries, read a book that had been gathering dust on the shelf for a long time, and finally began to prepare to enter the Faculty of Engineering. My life was just getting perfect, and I almost forgot about that little detective experience. But, suddenly, another unusual death occurred in our town.</p>
